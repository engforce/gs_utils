# GS Utils

A little side project that intends to create some tools to support Graphstream graphs.

At the moment only a simple, not yet complete, parser is available.

###Features list:
1. Save a GraphStream graph into a JSON file;
2. Load a GraphStream graph saved using GS Utils.

As this project sails into the future I'll list, here in this file, it's features!

Feel free to browse : D
